Go Fractal Library
==================

A library for creating images of fractal sets in Go.

Features:
 - Mandelbrot
 - customizable colouring

Please note: This repository was primarily created as a way for me to learn a few Go idioms, primarily Go routines. I have done no benchmarking to confirm in the existing usage of Go routines is optimal, or indeed remotely sensible.
